### What I learned

I learnt how to use css grid especially the repeat attribute, see beloe


```html
   <div class="nft">
            <div>
                <img src="./img/nft.png" width="70px" height="60px" alt="">
                <p>NFT</p>
            </div>
```
```css
 #what .nft {
    margin: auto;
    max-width: 900px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 20px 50px;
}
```
### Continued development    

I would love focusing more on Css animation since i discoovered am lacking more in that area.
